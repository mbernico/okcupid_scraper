# okcupid_scraper
This is a generic scraper for OK Cupid. 

My goal was to extract the more structured information from a random group of users, along with their profile pictures.  I believe this scraper could be easily modified to collect other things as well. 

###Thanks to Andrew Matteson
I got my start from [his blog](http://andrewmatteson.com/blog/2012/07/30/data-mining-okcupid/), and used his general approach.
